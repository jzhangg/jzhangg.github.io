Welcome! My name is Jiayue Zhang. I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Brown University. My research interests are development and environmental economics, with a focus on finance and firms. Most of my work involves field experiment and primary data collection in Ghana and Kenya. 

I am affiliated with the Population Studies and Training Center and Spatial Structures in the Social Sciences (S4) at Brown University. Prior to graduate school, I was a Manager at Hong Kong Monetary Authority.

I am currently on the 2025â€“26 academic job market in economics.
